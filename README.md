### [Journal: Career Choice](https://github.com/zbaran4240/CS-499/blob/main/Baran_CS499_Journal4-1.docx) 
In this journal my desired career choice and plans for the future are explained. It explains my plans with my Computer Science Degree as well as how my career choices have evolved throughout the years of working towards my degree.

## Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering
The artifact I chose for the software and design and engineering category is my final project from CS-330. The goal of the project was to create a 3-D scene of a picture that we had taken ourselves and submitted. In addition to creating the 3-D scene we had to ensure that a camera was able to move around the scene and look at the 3-D objects from different angles. 

This project was selected because it is a representation of software application and design. The original project did not have any background and the shapes were simple and primitively textured. The ehnacement aimed to add a background as well as improves the shapes and textures to show an improved and more realistic 3-D scene. Other additions included in line comments to prove readability. These enhancements demonstrate my ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques and skills by finding more advanced textures and shapes using resources found online.  

I learned that there are a vast amount of resources that can be used to enhance your code as well as learn new techniques. The challenges I faced with this improvement was minimal, as I felt I had a firm idea on what and how I wanted to improve the project.The course objectives that were met in this project were mainly building a collaborative environment as well and using well founded techniques and skills. 

## Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures
The artifact that I chose to demonstrate my skills with algorithms and Data Structures was a project from CS 405. This projects was a test module that is designed to search through a collection of entries in a data structure for funcionality and exploitable weaknesses.

I chose this project because it is an example of secure coding practices that are being used to protect data structures and algorithms. A major weakness of the project and any publicly available service application is an exploitable interface. For example, a common attack made of an application is a buffer overflow. This attack allows a malicious hacker to overflow an input's parameters for a denial of service attack or for an attempt to access the application's private data.

In my original project the task that was given led to mostly positive assertions tests being included. For the ehancement of this artifact I chose to increase the amount and variety of tests that were applied to the testing module. As was mentioned before most of the tests for the project led to positive asserts that verified something was true about a sample size. When I enhanced the project I included tests that tested for a negative assert, or tests that verified a given assertion was false. 

The course objectives that were completed for this project was improving the complexity using well founded techniques and skills as well as developing a security mindset thaty anticipates adversarial exploits in software design. 

Enchancing this article taught me the importance of improving the complexity of an artifact that tests data. Adding the additional tests showed me how much information can be drawn from tests that verify true or false. The only thing I struggled with this enhancement was with revisiting the material. It took me sometime to familiarize myself with the skills I used to create this project but once that was done I found the enhancements reasonable in difficulty. 

## Enhancement Three: Databases
The artifact that I chose to demonstrate my skills with databases was my project from CS-340. This project was created with python and was designed to interact witgh pymongo to work as the back-end structre for an interactive database for animal rescue centers. The project demonstrated basic CRUD functionality. After the enhancements the artifact was improved to use more advance SQL functions.

I selected the project because it is an example of how a database is constructed at the back end. The information in these databases is searched and modified by a commonly used language such as python. The initial project inlcuded create, read, update and delete SQL functionality, but after the enhancements it now includes count, insert multiple, update multiple, and delete multiple commands. These updates to the artifact show my ability to expand upon and update previous SQL and python structure code.

The course objectives that were a focus in this enhancment were using well founded tenchiques and skills to develop a more complex artifact as well as using techniques to build a collaboritve environment that can be interacted with by diverse audiences.

Enhancing this artifact taught me to deepen my appreciation for the usefulness of SQL commands. It also taught me how much a project can be approved just by adding more functionality. SQL was something that came rather easy to me, so I did not have any real difficulty in updating this artifact.


## Professional Self-Assessment:
Completing the Computer Science Bachelors program has been an incredible growing and hubmling experience both academically and personally. Over the course of the program I was able to refine my technical knowledge and skills that are essential to succeed in the computer science field. In addition to this my academic journal helped me to realize my professional identity as well as my career goals. This ePortfolio is an opportunity to display what I have learned, highlight was individual talents, and reflect on how my schooling as prepared me for a professional work setting. 

Throughout the degree I encountered a wide range of topics that collectively contribute to a well-rounded computer science proffesional. I have learned to approach problem solving systematically as well as efficiently. The projects displayed above as well as others I have completed during my time at SNHU have taught me to think critically while creating and designing scalable solutions. All which are extremely important skills in software development and system design.  Working through the full software development life cycle, from requirements gathering from stakeholders to deployment, I have become comfortable with version control systems such as Git, collaborative development tools, and agile methodologies. One particularly impactful project was Artifact One mentioned in this ePortfolio. This project had me recreate a picture of household items into a 3-D scene. This helped to enhance my understanding of how 3-D objects are created and manipulated through code. 

Cybersecurity was another key focus of my courses. Through hands-on learning I developed a strong foundation as well as an understanding of the importance in secure coding practices. These skills are important now more than ever with the increased amount of data breaches. Using proper securing coding practices in each stage of development, I am confident in my ability to properly protect important personal information.

The ability to work effectively in a team environment is a skill that I have also put emphasis on throughout my academic journey. This was because SNHU emphasized the importance of teamwork, effective communication, and stakeholder involvment. I believe it is important to be able to properly communicate complex technical ideas and solutions to the relevant target audience and SNHU has given me the tools and skills to do so. This skill is extremely important when there is an attempt to bridge the gap between the development team and the business stakeholders. 

Entering the next phase of my career I feel confident that SNHU has prepared me to contribute meaningfully in the field of computer science. This Computer Science degree has given me confidence that I have gained a strong technical foundation in problem-solving, the ability to work in a team environment and the ability to work with professional intergrity.
