# CS499  Computer Science Capstone August 2025

## Overview
This repository documents the process I took to develop my ePortfolio for the CS499 course final project. This portfolio will showcase my unique abilities and is one of the best ways to visually communicate my value to potential employers. 
The content in this ePortfolio will showcase my skills and abilities across the key fields of Computer Science. The included artifcats as well as their improvements will demonstrate my growth in the key categories of software disign and engineering, algorithms and data structure,
as well as databases. 

The chosen improved artifacts will help to establish a quality of work by addressing their limitations or iconsistencies as well as mitigating their security vulnerabilities. This ePortfolio will reflect my strong motivation, organization, and accomplishments towards the Computer Science degree.
